CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgeographic_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "geographic_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "geographic_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    geographic_msgsConfig.cmake
    geographic_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "geographic_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "geographic_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "geographic_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
